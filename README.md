# Few-shot Learning for Semantic Parsing

I will upload the datasets first and begin to refactor the code after the ACL deadline. Plan to finish the work before the formal meeting of EACL. In the meantime, you are welcomed to use the dataset to conduct your own experiments. And you are welcomed to directly propose questions to me via git issues or emails. Please excuse if any inconvenience caused.
